            <p style="padding:10px; font-size: 25px;">Hi! I am a programmer that focuses on video game development and technical art. My journey into computer science began early 2023 as an answer to one of my greatest questions: "How could logic and art be married?" This question led me to find the world of video game development, which, of course, includes technical art. The ability to combine logic (code) and artistic creativity was just what I was looking for. Today, I use programming to aid my creative process, through the use of intelegent systems and procedural generation<em>!</em></p>
