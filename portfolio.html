            <h3>FBLA: Revival</h3>
            <p>FBLA: Revival is a video game entry for the 2024 State and National FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming Competition. FBLA: Revival is made in Unreal Engine using Blueprints, a visual scripting, C++ based programming language. FBLA:Revival is the most complex project I have undertaken, as all assets are custom. Everything from models, to code, to effects, and to music are made by myself. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/bzTF7UK2LEM">See a video overview (voiced by a friend)</a></em></p>

            <h3>Technical Art Projects</h3>
            <p>When not programming, I create many pieces of technical art. Here are a few renders I have made. Most of my pieces end up in games, however. I use both Blender and Unreal Engine to create my renders. Blender is typically for stylized rendering and creating models, while Unreal Engine is for realistic renders. It is important to note that many of the landscapes and their fillers are procedural generated<em>!</em> I am to move towards portrait pieces and procedural pieces in the future. <em><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T0E03Ng34KzQ4d-NHVxTe0y-TkMHXS-e?usp=sharing">See a collection of my works</a></em></p>
